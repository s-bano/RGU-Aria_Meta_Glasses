## Overview

The Aria Meta Glasses project aims to develop an advanced wearable technology designed to assist users, such as students, in seamlessly identifying objects within their environment. By leveraging sophisticated machine perception algorithms, the glasses can detect and recognize objects, such as a laptop, without the need for the user to interact with them physically. The recognition information is relayed through a connected device, providing the user with immediate contextual awareness. Additionally, the glasses are equipped with embedded sensors that offer real-time navigation, enhancing the userâ€™s situational awareness. This project represents a significant step forward in integrating augmented reality and sensor technologies to create intuitive and practical applications for everyday use.

  - Initial code was deployed using the COCO dataset, followed by integration with the Aria Glasses dataset.
* Live Streaming:
  - Successfully implemented YOLOv8n model for live streaming using both USB and Wi-Fi.

## Hardware
- **Mono Scene Cameras:** Two cameras for visual tasks like Visual SLAM.
- **POV RGB Camera:** Forward-facing high-resolution camera.
- **Eye-Tracking Cameras:** Two inward-facing cameras for tracking gaze.
- **IMUs:** For tracking motion and orientation.
- **Microphone Array:** For spatial audio capture.
- **Magnetometer, Barometer, Thermometer:** For environmental awareness.
- **GNSS Receiver:** Provides geographic positioning.
- **Wi-Fi & Bluetooth Transceiver:** For wireless connectivity.

## Software
- **YOLOv8:** For real-time object detection.
- **COCO Pre-trained Dataset:** For initial training.
- **Roboflow:** For dataset annotation and preparation.

## Known Issues
- **Wi-Fi Streaming:** The stream opens but does not catch frames.
- **USB Streaming:** Works but prioritizes Wi-Fi even if the Wi-Fi is off.

## Future Enhancements
- **3D Detection:** Transition from 2D object detection to 3D.
- **Live Sensor Data:** Utilize live sensor data once Wi-Fi streaming is stabilized.
